## 📝 Optional Updates

The legal pages no longer contain placeholder contact details. Everything references the in-app help center, so you do not need to add emails or addresses.

If you want to fine-tune the documents before launch, you can optionally:

- Refresh the **Last Updated / Effective Date** lines when you ship a new version of the policies.
- Confirm the company name references the entity you wish to represent publicly.
- Add a short note in the help center describing response times for support tickets (handled outside these documents).

## 🔒 Legal Protections Included

### 1. Medical Liability Shield
```
"THE SERVICE IS NOT A MEDICAL DEVICE AND IS NOT INTENDED 
TO DIAGNOSE, TREAT, CURE, OR PREVENT ANY DISEASE."
```

Repeated in multiple places for maximum protection.

### 2. AI Limitations Disclosure
```
"The AI model is trained on historical data and may 
not reflect individual circumstances"

"The Service may produce false positive or false 
negative results"
```

Protects against claims of AI inaccuracy.

### 3. No Warranties
```
"THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS' WITHOUT WARRANTIES 
OF ANY KIND"
```

Standard software disclaimer.

### 4. Liability Caps
```
"Maximum liability: Amount paid for the Service (if any) 
in the 12 months preceding the claim."
```

Since it's free, this effectively limits liability to $0.

### 5. Indemnification
```
"You agree to indemnify and hold Rhizome harmless from 
claims arising from your use or misuse of the Service"
```

User assumes responsibility for their use.

### 6. Dispute Resolution
```
"Any disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration 
in Montreal, Quebec"
```

Avoids costly class action lawsuits.
