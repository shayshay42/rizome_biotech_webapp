## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Multiple CBC Entries Support

The database schema **already supports multiple CBC entries per user**:

```sql
CREATE TABLE cbc_results (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    questionnaire_id INTEGER REFERENCES questionnaires(id),
    test_date DATE,  -- ✅ Each entry can have different date
    file_format VARCHAR(50),  -- 'uploaded_file' or 'manual_entry'
    
    -- 7 key biomarkers
    wbc REAL,
    nlr REAL,
    hgb REAL (renamed to hgb in migration),
    mcv REAL,
    plt REAL,
    rdw REAL,
    mono_abs REAL,
    
    -- ML predictions
    risk_score REAL,
    risk_interpretation JSONB,
    
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- No UNIQUE constraint on user_id
-- Users can have unlimited CBC entries! ✅
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ No unique constraint on `user_id` → Multiple entries allowed
- ✅ `test_date` field stores when blood test was taken
- ✅ `created_at` stores when entry was uploaded
- ✅ `file_format` distinguishes uploads vs manual entries
- ✅ Foreign key with CASCADE DELETE keeps data clean

## 📊 User Flow

### Registration & Login
```
1. User visits landing page
2. Reads About Us section
3. Clicks Sign Up tab
4. Enters username, email, password
   → Username stored in auth.users AND user_profiles
5. Receives verification email
6. Signs in with email/password
   → Username synced to database
```

### Adding CBC Data (Multiple Times)
```
User can add CBC data multiple times:

Upload #1 (Today):
├─ Upload PDF or enter manually
├─ Specify test date: 2025-10-08
├─ AI analyzes → Risk score calculated
└─ Saved to cbc_results table

Upload #2 (Next month):
├─ Upload new PDF or enter new values
├─ Specify test date: 2025-11-08
├─ AI analyzes → New risk score
└─ Saved as NEW ROW in cbc_results table

Upload #3 (Later):
├─ And so on...
└─ Each entry is separate with its own date
```

**Result:** Users can track trends over time! 📈

## ✅ Manual Entry Implementation - Complete!

**You were absolutely right!** No separate `process_manual_cbc_entry()` function is needed.

### Why?

The cancer classifier works **directly with CBC dictionaries**, not database records:

```
Data Flow:
User Input → CBC Dict → predict_cancer_risk() → Prediction → save_cbc_results() → Database
```

### Implementation in streamlit_app.py:

```python
if manual_entry:
    # 1. Collect values from form into dict
    cbc_data = {
        'WBC': manual_wbc,
        'NLR': manual_nlr,
        'HGB': manual_hgb,
        'MCV': manual_mcv,
        'PLT': manual_plt,
        'RDW': manual_rdw,
        'MONO': manual_mono
    }
    
    # 2. Call classifier DIRECTLY (same as file upload does)
    from utils.cancer_classifier import predict_cancer_risk
    prediction = predict_cancer_risk(cbc_data)
    
    # 3. Save to database (same as file upload does)
    save_cbc_results(user_id, questionnaire_id, cbc_data, prediction, ...)
```

**The database is ONLY for persistence, not model input!** ✅
