# CBC Data Flow - How Manual Entry Works

## You Were Right! 🎯

You correctly identified that we don't need a separate `process_manual_cbc_entry()` function because **the cancer classifier already works directly with CBC dictionaries**, not with database records.

## The Actual Data Flow

### For Uploaded Files:
```
1. User uploads PDF/image
   ↓
2. extract_cbc_from_pdf() extracts values → returns cbc_data dict
   ↓
3. predict_cancer_risk(cbc_data) analyzes → returns prediction
   ↓
4. save_cbc_results() saves to database
   ↓
5. Dashboard reads from database to display results
```

### For Manual Entry (NEW):
```
1. User enters 7 biomarkers manually
   ↓
2. Form collects values → creates cbc_data dict
   ↓
3. predict_cancer_risk(cbc_data) analyzes → returns prediction
   ↓
4. save_cbc_results() saves to database
   ↓
5. Dashboard reads from database to display results
```

## Key Insight

**The cancer classifier NEVER reads from the database!**

- It takes a Python dictionary with CBC values
- It returns a prediction dictionary
- The database is ONLY for storage (not input to the model)

## What Changed

### Before (Incorrect Understanding):
```python
# I mistakenly thought we needed a separate function
def process_manual_cbc_entry():
    # Read from database → process → return
    pass
```

### After (Correct Implementation):
```python
# Manual entry flow (in streamlit_app.py):
if manual_entry:
    # Just create the dict directly
    cbc_data = {
        'WBC': manual_wbc,
        'NLR': manual_nlr,
        'HGB': manual_hgb,
        'MCV': manual_mcv,
        'PLT': manual_plt,
        'RDW': manual_rdw,
        'MONO': manual_mono
    }
    
    # Call classifier directly (same as upload does)
    from utils.cancer_classifier import predict_cancer_risk
    prediction = predict_cancer_risk(cbc_data)
    
    # Save to database (same as upload does)
    save_cbc_results(...)
```

## Multi-Timepoint Support

The database schema **already supports** multiple CBC entries per user:

```sql
CREATE TABLE cbc_results (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id UUID,                    -- No UNIQUE constraint!
    test_date DATE,                   -- Different dates = different entries
    wbc REAL,
    nlr REAL,
    ...
);
```

**This means:**
- User can upload CBC values multiple times
- Each with its own `test_date`
- All entries are stored separately
- Dashboard can show trends over time

## Cancer Classifier API

The classifier only needs these 7 values:

```python
cbc_data = {
    'WBC': float,   # White Blood Cells (10^9/L)
    'NLR': float,   # Neutrophil/Lymphocyte Ratio
    'HGB': float,   # Hemoglobin (g/L)
    'MCV': float,   # Mean Corpuscular Volume (fL)
    'PLT': float,   # Platelets (10^9/L)
    'RDW': float,   # Red Cell Distribution Width (%)
    'MONO': float   # Monocytes (10^9/L)
}

prediction = predict_cancer_risk(cbc_data)
# Returns: {
#     'cancer_probability_pct': float,
#     'risk_level': str,
#     'confidence': float,
#     'missing_features': list,
#     'imputed_count': int
# }
```

## Why This is Better

### Old Approach (What I Suggested):
❌ Separate function for manual entry  
❌ Different code paths for upload vs manual  
❌ More complexity  
❌ Harder to maintain  

### New Approach (Your Insight):
✅ Same code path for both input methods  
✅ Cancer classifier is input-agnostic  
✅ Database is just for persistence  
✅ Simpler, cleaner architecture  

## Implementation Complete! ✅

The streamlit_app.py now:

1. ✅ Has radio button to choose upload vs manual entry
2. ✅ Shows 7 number_input fields for manual entry
3. ✅ Collects manual values into a dictionary
4. ✅ Calls `predict_cancer_risk()` directly (same as upload)
5. ✅ Saves results to database (same as upload)
6. ✅ Supports multiple entries per user (via test_date)

**No separate `process_manual_cbc_entry()` function needed!** 🎉

## Thank You!

Your question helped clarify the architecture and led to a simpler, better implementation.
